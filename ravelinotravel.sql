The purpose of the center was to rehabilitate orangutans released from captivity. The rangers at the center teach the orangutan all the necessary skills to survive in the wild. After an intense period of quarantine, readjustment to the natural habitat and reintegration into the (semi-)wild population, the orangutan is released back into the jungle. All orangutans released are still monitored by the rangers through the feeding platform not exist anymore due to orangutan is getting more and wilder.</div><div align=\"justify\">Seeing orangutans is a magical experience.

In Ketambe, you can go to 1-7 days treks into the jungle.&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">The best experience is an encounter in the jungle where there are many semi-wild and wild animals. The wild orangutan can be difficult to spot unless you go\r\ndeep\r\ninto the jungle. There are also white and black gibbons that make an amazing noise calling out to each other, and Thomas Leaf monkeys.\r\nIf you are lucky, you may be able to see hornbills, toucans, moon snakes, monitor lizards.&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">Since there are very few\r\n(hundreds) still alive, it is very improbable that either the Sumatran Tiger or the Sumatran Rhinoceros will be encountered, although footprints and droppings have been reported.\r\nIf you really want to see a tiger, you have to go deep and be patient (waiting for weeks).&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">A jungle trek is a must. Seeing the orangutan in the wild may be one of the best experiences you will have in your life.&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">Everyone who is planning to go on a jungle trek is asked to refrain from any physical contact with the orangutans. Getting too close to an orangutan increases the risk of passing on disease and viral infection, which jeopardizes the orangutan\'s chances of survival and in turn the health and survival of the wild orangutan population in the entire area. All guests should keep at least 10 meters away and move away if an orangutan approaches.

According to the National Development Planning Agency, Medan is one of the four main central cities of Indonesia, alongside Jakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar.<br><br>Medan was dubbed by the Dutch Parijs van Sumatra due to the city\'s resemblance to Paris. Lamudi, a worldwide real estate portal, recognized Medan as one among six cities in Asia to feature and preserve several colonial architectural sites, while accompanying its growth as a metropolitan city. Medan is also known as the \"City of Million Shophouses\", as the majority of the population work in the trade sector, opening shops right under their houses. In recent years, the city has undergone rapid development, which made the residential property prices in Medan trend upward. According to Bank Indonesia (BI).<br><br>Tourists can expect a diversity of cultures in this city, as almost every ethnicity in the country is represented in this place: Acehnese, Batak, Chinese, Indians, Javanese, Malay and Minang, however, there is no ethnic group that is considered a majority.<br></p><p align=\"justify\">Before Medan became a sprawling city, it was a trading and seafaring town under Islamic Malay leadership during its early days. It was in the 19th century when the city\'s commercial potential was uncovered. Because of plantation agriculture, Medan transformed from a small town to the prosperous city that it is today.<br><br>The influence of the Dutch and all other cultures that have made their mark in the city are clearly imprinted on the metropolis, as exemplified by the attractions and architectural landmarks found in Medan.<br><br>One example is the Maimoon Palace, which was built in 1888 by the Sultan of Deli. This grand attraction is a 30-room structure built with Malay, Mogul and Italian influences. Out of the 30 rooms, only the main room is accessible to the public. This is where tourists can find the opulent inaugural throne. Meanwhile, the back wing of the palace is occupied by the members of the family of the current Sultan.<br><br>Another famous attraction in Medan is the Tjong A Fie Mansion. The landmark is named after the Chinese-Indonesian merchant who used to live there. Like the Maimoon Palace, the most remarkable thing about the mansion is its architecture, which is a fusion of Victorian and Chinese styles.<br><br>Other attractions worth seeing include the Sri Mariamman Temple, the Mesjid Raya Mosque and the Bukit Barisan Military Museum.<br></p>					                                					                                					                                ', '<p align=\"justify\">                                                    <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For travelers, Medan is famous as the entry point to North Sumatra. \r\nAside from serving as the gateway to the region, the city also functions\r\n as a commercial and economic hub, this Indonesian city attracts not \r\nonly shoppers, but also business professionals and entrepreneurs. Medan \r\nis a modern metropolis and like other Asian cities, it can be very busy \r\nand suffer from heavy traffic.</span></p><p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Medan has many tourist attractions that make the city one of the popular places to visit in Indonesia such as : Sultan Palace, Grand Mosque (Masjid Raya Al Mashun), Tjong A Fie Mansion, North Sumatra Museum, Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni Church, Chinese temple, Hindu\'s temple, several old colonial building which was built during Dutch time etc.</span><br></p>                                                                                                                                                            ', 'images/Medan-GREAT MOSQUE.JPG', 12),
