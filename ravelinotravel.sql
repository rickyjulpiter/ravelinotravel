Many of these structures survive to today, and can be seen along the road leading to the Dago area north of the city.<br><br>After Indonesian independence, Bandung was named as the provincial capital of West Java. Bandung was the site of the Bandung Conference which met April 18-April 24, 1955 with the aim of promoting economic and cultural cooperation among the African and Asian countries, and to counter the threat of colonialism or neocolonialism by the United States, the Soviet Union, or other imperialistic nations.<br><br><b>Where Two Continents Meet</b><br>Worlwide, Bandung is better known today for its historic Bandung Conference, - otherwise known as the first Asian-African Conference in 1955, that brought together 29 newly independent countries from the two continents representing over half of the world\'s population. Delegations were headed by legendary leaders that included Jawaharlal Nehru and daughter Indira Gandhi, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Prime Minister Zhou En Lai of China and of course Indonesia\'s own President Soekarno, and many, many more.<br><br>But back in Dutch colonial days, at the beginning of the 20th century, Bandung was the favorite resort of wealthy tea and coffee planters owners of swathes of undulating tea and coffee plantations. Bandung was then also dubbed the elegant \" Parijs van Java\", the Paris of Java. For this reason also, in Central Bandung you can still admire Art Deco buildings of Dutch colonial heritage, that include \"Gedung Sate\" the Governor\'s office building; the present Bidakara Homann Hotel, and Gedung Merdeka, venue for the Asian-African Conference with its attached Museum. Reminiscent also of those heydays, some restaurants still serve genuine, sizzling Dutch Beef steaks and Dutch bitterballen, for food-lovers to make a beeline to Bandung.<br><br><b>Where Love and Culture Collides</b><br>Indeed,\"Pasundan (the land of the Sundanese in the West Java province) was created when God was smiling\", said MAW Brouwer, renowned Dutch psychologist, and writer who spent most of his life in Bandung. While, Pidi Baiq â€“ Bandung\'s own multitalented artists and pop culture icon - said: \"Bandung is not just a mere spot on the map. More than that, it evokes lasting emotions that remain silently within me\". These two quotes are carved right by Bandung\'s Big Square in the heart of the city and illustrate the irresistible charm that spells: Bandung.<br><br>Bandung is also a university city, most prominently known for its Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), from where Indonesia\'s first President Soekarno graduated, and which persistently produces the country\'s best engineers and scientists until today. Bandung is now also developed to become the Creative City, where millennials and students are encouraged to express their exuberant creativity in art, music and innovative digital creations.<br><br>While, for affordable latest fashion trends, the city is second to none. There are factory outlets galore in Distros that dot the main Dago avenue (now called Jalan Ir. H. Juanda), along Jalan Riau (officially known as Jalan R.E. Martadinata), or on the way up to Lembang at Jalan Setiabudi, where cars regularly jam the roads and parking lots. But if you are looking for bales of affordable textiles, then you should go to Pasar Baru Trade Center where you can practice your bargaining skills and get special discounts for buying clothes and materials in bulk.<br><br>Whereas, for those looking for unique selfie spots, you are in the right city! Those who love nature at its finest should walk up the dramatic hills of Tebing Keraton or The Royal (Palace) Cliff, the peak of Moko Hill, Eurad Highland Lembang, or the Stone Garden Citatah. For special attractions with special features, visit the Farm House at Lembang where you discover a hobbit village and Victorian English towns. At De Ranch Lembang selfies are spot-on in cowboy-style surroundings. Do visit the Rabbit Town which dedicates itself as a \'selfie\' tourist attraction offering a range of selfie spots just the thing to send on to friends on Instagram and Youtube. Another attraction is Bandung\'s Amazing Art World where you can take hundreds of unique photos with 3D effects or get to the Upside Down World, where the world is literally turned upside down for you to take pictures, that are sure to amaze your friends and family. Your experiences here will surely linger on for a long while.<br><br>On the other hand, if you wish to get close to the local people, its music, dance, and culture, then Saung Angklung Udjo or Udjo\'s House of Angklung is one you should not miss. Famed for its Angklung, the local traditional bamboo musical instrument, here you can watch a children orchestra present delightful music shaking the Angklung and perform Sundanese dances and music.

It is located at Magelang, 90-km southeast of Semarang, or \r\n42-km northwest of Yogyakarta. Borobudur temple is the one of the \r\nbest-preserved ancient monument in Indonesia that are most frequently \r\nvisited by over a million domestic as well as foreign visitors. It also \r\nhad been acclaimed by the world as a cultural heritage main kind. The \r\narchitectural style has no equal through out the world. It was completed\r\n centuries before Angkor Wat in Kamboja. Borobudur is one of the world\'s\r\n most famous temples; it stands majestically on a hilltop overlooking \r\nlush green fields and distant hills. Borobudur is built of gray andesite\r\n stone. It rises to seven terraces, each smaller than the one below it. \r\nThe top is the Great Stupa, standing 40 meters above the ground. The \r\nwalls of the Borobudur are sculptured in bas-reliefs extending over a \r\ntotal length of six kilometers. It has been hailed as the largest and \r\nmost complete ensemble of Buddhist relieves in the world, unsurpassed in\r\n artistic merit and each scene an individual masterpiece.<br><br>Borobudur\r\n temple built in the eighth century by the Cailendra dynasty, is \r\nbelieved to have been derived from the Sanskrit words \"Vihara Buddha \r\nUhr\" the Buddhist Monastery on the hill. Borobudur is a terraced temple \r\nsurmounted by stupas, or stone towers; the terraces resemble Indonesian \r\nburial foundations, indicating that Borobudur was regarded as the symbol\r\n of the final resting place of its founder, a Syailendra, who was united\r\n after his death with the Buddha. The Prambanan temple complex is also \r\nassociated with a dead king. The inscription of 856 mentions a royal \r\nfuneral ceremony and shows that the dead king had joined Shiva, just as \r\nthe founder of the Borobudur monument had joined the Buddha. Divine \r\nattributes, however, had been ascribed to kings during their lifetimes. A\r\n Mahayana inscription of this period shows that a ruler was said to have\r\n the purifying powers of a bodhisattva, the status assumed by the ruler \r\nof Shrivijaya in the 7th century; a 9th-century Shaivite inscription \r\nfrom the Kedu Plain describes a ruler as being \"a portion of Shiva.\"<br><br>The\r\n Borobudur was in danger of collapsing as its stone statues and stone \r\ncancer, moss and lichen affected bas-reliefs. But, the monument has been\r\n completely restored and was officially opened by the President on 23rd \r\nFebruary 1983. The restoration took eight years to complete, funded by \r\nthe Government of Indonesia with aid from the UNESCO and donations from \r\nprivate citizens as well as from foreign governments.<br><br>The \r\nvisitors have the option of going by taxi or public bus to reach this \r\ntemple. Public transportation is available from the bus terminal. From \r\nthat point visitors can hire becaks or horse carts, or walk the rest of \r\nthe way to the monument. A large parking area is available not far from \r\nthe monument, so private cars and buses can park in this area.<br><br>It\r\n covers an enormous area, measuring 123 x 123 meters. The monument is a \r\nmarvel of design, decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha \r\nstatues. The architecture and stonework of this temple has no equal. And\r\n it was built without using any kind of cement or mortar! The structure \r\nis like a set of massive interlocking Lego blocks held together without \r\nany glue.<br>The temple has remained strong even through ten centuries \r\nof neglect. It was rediscovered in 1815, buried under volcanic ash. In \r\nthe 1970â€™s the Indonesian Government and UNESCO worked together to \r\nrestore Borobudur to its former majesty The restoration took eight years\r\n to complete and today Borobudur is one of Indonesia and the worldâ€™s \r\nmost valuable treasures.<br>The temple has remained strong even through \r\nten centuries of neglect.

The purpose of the center was to rehabilitate orangutans released from captivity. The rangers at the center teach the orangutan all the necessary skills to survive in the wild. After an intense period of quarantine, readjustment to the natural habitat and reintegration into the (semi-)wild population, the orangutan is released back into the jungle. All orangutans released are still monitored by the rangers through the feeding platform not exist anymore due to orangutan is getting more and wilder.</div><div align=\"justify\">Seeing orangutans is a magical experience.

The wild orangutan can be difficult to spot unless you go\r\ndeep\r\ninto the jungle. There are also white and black gibbons that make an amazing noise calling out to each other, and Thomas Leaf monkeys.\r\nIf you are lucky, you may be able to see hornbills, toucans, moon snakes, monitor lizards.&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">Since there are very few\r\n(hundreds) still alive, it is very improbable that either the Sumatran Tiger or the Sumatran Rhinoceros will be encountered, although footprints and droppings have been reported.\r\nIf you really want to see a tiger, you have to go deep and be patient (waiting for weeks).&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">A jungle trek is a must. Seeing the orangutan in the wild may be one of the best experiences you will have in your life.&nbsp;</div><div align=\"justify\">Everyone who is planning to go on a jungle trek is asked to refrain from any physical contact with the orangutans. Getting too close to an orangutan increases the risk of passing on disease and viral infection, which jeopardizes the orangutan\'s chances of survival and in turn the health and survival of the wild orangutan population in the entire area. All guests should keep at least 10 meters away and move away if an orangutan approaches.

The Cheng Ho mosque has been constructed here in his honor.<br>Although structure-wise not much remains to be seen from Sriwijaya\'s golden age, Palembang\'s fine silver and gold songket woven cloths that are still produced even today, the fine lacquerware it creates for which Palembang is renowned, and its regal dances and opulent gold costumes are evidence of its precious royal heritage.</p><p align=\"justify\"><br>The City of River<br>Palembang is situated along the Musi River, which has its source deep in the Bukit Barisan mountains, tumbling down to reach the plains where, fed by the converging Ogam and Komering rivers, it then widens into a large river as it reaches Palembang. Its many tributaries and streams that cut through Palembang, caused this town at times to be called \'The Venice of the East\'.<br>Spanning across the Musi river right in the heart of the city, the Ampera Bridge built in 1965 is today\'s icon of modern Palembang. The view from the Musi river from this vantage point is breathtaking. Watch vendors on boats sell their ware at the floating market by the Ampera Bridge, while at sunset the view with the many houses on stilts along both sides of the Musi and the centuries\' old quaint Chinese shop-houses, are sights rarely found elsewhere.<br>Located in the Musi River delta, another precious gem of Palembang is the tiny island of Kamaro which is adorned with pagodas and Chinese temples. A magnificent Chinese Temple, the Hok Cing Bio stands splendidly here. On special occasions, especially on \'Cap Go Meh\' Chinese New Year\'s celebrations, the island is always packed with locals and visitors coming from Palembang, Java, Kalimantan and overseas from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.<br>nother important Landmark of the city is the Kuto Besak Fortress which was built during the 17 th century and a legacy of the Palembang Darussalam Sultanate, that ruled from 1550-1823. Each corner of the fort is strengthened with bastions. The bastion in the west corner is larger and similar to other forts in Indonesia while the other three bastions are architecturally unique, and are unlikely found elsewhere. And as the sun sets in the afternoon, lights glow around the fort, creating sparkles that highlight the walls of the fort: truly a sight to be watched.<br>Those who wish to take a trip back in time and explore the history of the golden era of Palembang can visit the Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Museum (SMB II) situated on Musi\'s Riverbank. Not only is the museum rich in its collections, but the building itself is a historical legacy, as is a monument of the heydays of the Palembang Sultanate. Museum Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II is a perfect place to explore the history of Palembang. From the age of Sriwijaya to the Palembang Darussalam Sultanate, through the Dutch colonial era and the Japanese occupation up to the early era of Indonesia\'s independence are all presented in its 368 collections.<br>Last, but not the least important is the new Jakabaring Stadium, the new pride of Palembang, where the 18th Asian Games competitions will be held.<br>As for Food and Shopping, Palembang is a treasure trove to find the best gold and silver songket cloths, laquerware and woodcarvings.

This insurgency used the jungle as a place to hide and launch lightning raids on their opponents.

In fact, dribs and drabs of buyers from around the world stop in Takengon to meet with the various local coffee co-ops to get a better understanding of how their coffee is grown and processed and to seal supply deals. If recognition of this coffee continues to increase at the rate itâ€™s currently at, expect coffee tourism to become a thing over the next decade.<br>The climate in the Gayo Highlands gives rise to stunning misty mountains, tiny villages enveloped in seemingly perpetual drizzle and a temperature thatâ€™s cool compared to Banda Aceh and the surrounding coastal areas. Itâ€™s the sort of place you come if you donâ€™t want to be running into other tourists and want to just disconnect from the outside world for a while. The best itinerary for Takengon involves Ketambe to the south and Banda Aceh to the north. <a href=\"http://www.travelfish.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.travelfish.org</a><a href=\"http://www.travelfish.org\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\"><b>Takengon offers many options of nature tourism :<br><br>The Nuance</b><br>The most important thing people should know about Takengon City is related to its geological position, which is considered high. No wonder, lots of tourists call it a city of the clouds! It resides about 1,200 meters above the sea level and makes it a region with cold temperature. Not only visitors can enjoy stunning views from there, they can also visit some local attractions including the fresh water lake, Putri Pukes Cave, and Pantan Terong. On top of that, the air feels so refreshing and the locals are friendly to everyone.<br><b><br>Exploring Takengon City</b><br>Once arriving at Takengon City, tourists can start exploring the region. In this case, it is better to hire a local guide as he can help regarding routes, accommodations, and other information. He even provides some facts related to the city! For instance, it is the history of Takengon. The name means â€œTikunganâ€ or winding. The locals named it that way because everyone should pass through winding roads in the hill when heading to the city. This is why a trip to Takengon is both challenging and fun, featuring lush trees, cliffs, and other breathtaking views of nature.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Laut Tawar Lake, walk to the lakefront to see the fishing villages. Starting in the morning you can walk all the 25 kilometres to the other end. If you go on a Sundays, you will have company, as the whole region goes to the lake to party and to relax.<br><br>When it comes to tourists activities, many fun things can be done in Takengon City. It is as simple as riding a bicycle and get around the site in the morning. During the activity, tourists can feel a refreshing nature nuance and meet some locals. No wonder, most people who come to the city have a similar reason why they spend the weekend in Takengon, which is to eradicate stresses and get closer to nature. Have no worries. Some locals provide the bikes for rent!<br><br>The next fun activity to do is to visit local coffee and tobacco plantations. Well, Takengon is famous for their Arabica Coffee, after all. It is even possible to take a sip of the coffee in any local food vendors (Warung) during the vacation. Later, tourists can visit a nearby lake and encounter some exotic animals like forest cats, deer, pangolins, and many others. Do not forget to carry a camera and take pictures of them!<br></div>					                                ', '<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Takengon is located in the heart of the Gayo Highlands which stretches \r\nalong a ridge from the north of Aceh and ends in the south almost at the\r\n border of North Sumatra, the city often becomes a choice when it comes to a vacation. Not only it features beautiful nature, but it also consists of several cities for tourists to explore. Here is an example. The name is Takengon that offers many options of nature tourism.

A cluster of 99 mostly uninhabited islands, the Banyak (Many) Islands are situated about 30km west of Singkil. Remote they might be, but they are now very much on the radar of paradise-seeking travellers and surfers. As well as having arguably the finest beaches in Sumatra and a handful of quality surf spots, the Banyaks feature Sumatraâ€™s best snorkelling, with beautiful underwater forests of colourful coral (at least where there has been no past dynamite fishing). (https://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/banyak-islands).<br><b><br>What to do in Pulau Banyak :</b><br><b><br>Snorkeling</b><br>There is shallow water and corals everywhere! Bring your own gear or rent it in the villages. You can see a lot of different sea life. At Sikandang you can even see whales and dolphins. Near Rago Rago you can see Dugongs (Sea cow) if you are lucky because they don\'t like disturbance. Also turtles, manta rays and much more species are available.<br><b><br>Kayaking</b><br>If you are an experienced kayaker you can go alone, but if you are new to kayaking, you should be accompanied by a guide. Costs more, but is worth the risk. Some tourist already disappeared because of missing experience.<br><b><br>Island Hopping</b><br>Many of the lonely islands are close to each other and many nice beaches are available. In one day you can visit several islands, either by kayak, or you charter a local boat and let you drop off on the islands you like.<br>Camping<br><br>You can camp on most islands. Best is Asok, because there are no mosquitos and also a small hut with shower is available. But also the very small islands are mosquito free and great locations for camping.<br>.<b><br>Surfing</b><br>The islands are scattered with numerous coral reefs that are habitat to a diverse range of species including green and leatherback sea turtles, a variety of fish, octopus and lobster species, as well as other sea life. Although, the region has recently experienced some challenges with illegal hunting and environmental hazards, that are affecting its precious ecosystem.<br><br>Like other islands in the region, the Banyak Islands are perfectly situated to receive constant swell from the Southern Indian Ocean; waves come to the islandâ€™s shores with perfect form and consistency. Glassy conditions are produced by light winds and big waves are produced by large ground swell.<br><b><br>Jungle trekking</b><br>The big island on the middle is great for jungle trekking. You should start in Haloban, where you can find guides and equipment (as of equipment - not even machette needed if you can handle couple of scratches from the abundant vegetation). You can climb up the 260m high mountain, which takes around 3 hours. You can also visit the crocodile river with a guide. Furthermore, you can combine trekking with kayaking, start with the kayak, go up a river and do a 1-2 hours trek to a very long white beach. Also many caves and waterfalls available.<br><b><br>Fishing</b><br>It is possible to go fishing with locals. Simply ask around and you are likely to find a fisher who takes you on his fishing trip.<br><b><br>Relaxing</b><br>With its lonely white beaches and fantastic scenery, the Banyak islands are a great place for just relaxing and sunbathing. <br>', '                                                    <b>The Banyak Islands</b> <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">are a group of inhabited islands located between Simeulue and Nias off the western coast of Sumatra in Indonesia\'s Aceh Province. Surveys of the area approximate around 71 islands and additional mangrove stands in shallow off-shore areas, although locals count 99 islands.The largest island in the group is Tuangku, with the principal town of Haloban. Two other major islands located either side of Tuangku are Bangkaru and Ujung Batu. Tuangku is separated from Bangkaru by a fault line.</span><br>', NULL, 12),
(71, 'Way Kambas', '<div align=\"justify\">Officially established in 1985, the Elephant Training Center, located 9 km from the parkâ€™s Plang Ijo entrance, is an establishment aimed to protect the existence of the elephant and at the same time create mutual benefit for both the elephants and men. The training center is also a reminiscent of the time when kings or sultans ruled Sumatra, when elephants were trained and deployed in warfare and also for ceremonial purposes. Here, visitors can observe elephants perform various tasks such as transporting lumber or plowing fields. They can also perform peculiar activities such as playing football or other entertaining performances.\r\nWay Kambas National Park is located in Lampung province, South Sumatra, Indonesia. This national Park is consisting of forest and preservation for Sumatran tigers and elephant sanctuary. This park also becomes a breeding center or Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary (SRS) that has been build up in 1995. Way Kambas National Park is a representative of the lowland forest ecosystem consisting of freshwater swamp forest, meadow grass, and coastal forests in Sumatra.\r\nPlant species that grow in this national park are, api-api (Avicennia marina), Sonneratia (Sonneratia sp.), Palm (Nypa fruticans), Gelam (Melaleuca leucadendron), salam (Syzygium polyanthum), mire (Glochidion borneensis), almond (Terminalia cattapa), sea pine (Casuarina equisetifolia), pandan (Pandanus sp.), puspa (Schima wallichii), meranti (Shorea sp.), oil (Dipterocarpus gracilis), and ramin (Gonystylus bancanus).\r\n\r\nWay Kambas National Park has 50 species of mammals such as Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis), Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus), Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), tapir (Tapirus indicus), coyote (Cuon alpinus sumatrensis), gibbon (Hylobates syndactylus syndactylus); 406 forest bird species including ducks (Cairina scutulata), yarn and clothing stork (Ciconia episcopus stormi), stork casks (Leptoptilos javanicus), Crested Fireback (Lophura ignita), Peacock (Argusianus argus argus), Little Cormorant snake ( Anhinga melanogaster); different types of reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects.\r\n\r\nWild elephants which are trained in the Elephant Training Centre can be used as elephant riding, attractions, transport timber and plow the fields. At the elephant training center, we can see trainers that educate and train wild elephants, we can also see the attraction of elephants playing football, dancing, shaking hands, respectfully, draping flowers, pull the rope, swimming and many other attractions. This elephant training center was established in 1985. Until this day, it has been successful in educating and tame elephants around 290 elephants.\r\n\r\nWay Kambas National Park consists of 1,300 square kilometres of swamp forest and lowland rainforest.\r\nBecoming a reserve in 1972, It has long been known for its significant population of Sumatran Elephants as well as Sumatran Tigers, Macaques, Siamang Gibbons,Malayan Tapirs, and over 300 recorded bird species including the endemic White Winged Duck.\r\nIn the 1990s, it was revealed that the park was also home to a little-known or seen population of around 40 Sumatran Rhinos â€“ one of only three surviving populations in Indonesia.\r\nThe park now contains a Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary and an Elephant Conservation Centre including an Elephant Hospital, all committed to the conservation and care of these rare and endangered species.\r\nThe Siamang Gibbons have unique voices and are very noisy in the mornings, and if you are lucky you might see them. Every once in a while, our guests even catch sight of a Sumatran Tiger!\r\n\r\nRiver Safari Trip\r\nThe river safari is a fantastic opportunity to see everything the park has to offer, see Crocodiles, primates, birds, mammals perhaps even a Sun Bear or wild Elephants. It is very unlikely, but you may even see a Rhino or Tiger!\r\nThe river safari trips are arranged through the national park and a ranger will accompany you or your group on the boat and for a hike into the Tiger habitat. The river safari usually starts in the afternoon and runs into the evening where you can enjoy a fabulous atmosphere as the dark closes in.\r\nInclude a walk on the main way to the Kanan River and also past the Elephant Centre to Bambangan, some birding groups see or hear over 150 species of birds during an extended stay. The endemic White Winged Wood Duck is one to watch for.\r\n\r\nA night walk tour is not to be missed! Join our experienced local guide Heri for one of his exciting night walks through the National Park. The sights and sounds of the flora and fauna are entirely different at night! Here you will see and hear the behaviour of nocturnal birds, and mammals, and if you are\r\nFrom the river boat you can also head to Kalibiru (around 60 minutes). Here you can enjoy a fascinating walk to Rawa Gajah, a swamp area where wild Elephants are often seen. Depending on the season, this area is may be grassland or it may be submerged under waist deep water. Sambar Seer, Wild Pigs, Binturong and the endangered White Winged Wood Duck have all been seen here. The trail often shows scats, pug marks and tree scratchings from Tigers.\r\nAfter a picnic lunch, take a slow walk back to the boat and you may see primates, different bird species, deer or elephants on the journey home.\r\n\r\nThe Elephant Response Unit is a unique and innovative project that has successfully saved hundreds of wild elephants from harm. The unit was devised to reduce the conflict between humans and elephants, by using trained elephants to herd wild elephants away from villages. With fewer elephants destroying villages, fewer villagers now harm or kill the elephants in an effort to protect their homes and agriculture.\r\nThe ERU has staff monitoring nightly for marauding elephants. You can visit unit headquarters during your stay here and even attend any callouts that may happen while you are present. This is an exciting opportunity for our guests to see their work in action\r\nThe Elephant Conservation Centre offers a great opportunity to see the unique life long relationship between a Mahout and their Elephant. When visiting bring some sugar cane from the lodge grounds to help you make friends! If you wish, you can stay here all day to help to wash and feed the local residents too.\r\n\r\nTake a stroll here for a snapshot of day to day living. Most villagers work as farmers and gardeners, and if you wish we can book the local dance performance group to entertain you at the lodge.\r\nBambagan is an area 12 km beyond the Elephant Centre which has suffered from fire destruction and is being reforested by the park with the help of the NGO - ALERT Conservation. The area is still threatened by poachers and illegal burning.\r\nA visit to Bambangan includes the Ranger station where you will be given a local perspective of the area by a park ranger. Here you will enjoy a picnic lunch and meet some unique park rangers who have dedicated their lives to conservation.\r\nYou can also plant a tree for a minimal fee and contribute to the reforestation and new forest around you. After a siesta, it is time for a short hike to the river accompanied by your guide and a park ranger to see if you can catch a glimpse of the endemic White Winged Wood Duck and many other exotic\r\nIf you love butterflies, visit Butterfly Bridge one day for lunch â€“ here up to 50 species have been seen during a one-hour period. Large populations of butterflies occur only at certain times of the year prior and just after the rains; but try anyway.\r\nSumatran Rhino Tour Indonesia\r\nRhino Conservation\r\nWay Kambas National Park is also home to the Sumatran Rhino Conservation Centre. The centre is currently closed to visitors due to a health and breeding program for this critically endangered species.\r\nTaronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia is the biggest funder for this important project and it is now possible for some visitors to arrange to meet with the resident veterinarian.

Here, gibbons and macaques and a variety of wildlife still roam freely as this area in the Lima Puluh Kota district has actually been designated nature conservation, covering some 669 acres. Its beautiful landscape, its peaceful serenity interrupted only by the calls of the macaques and the chirping of birds, make the Harau Valley the perfect holiday getaway.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; \"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The steep rock walls here are not only a natural invitation to photographers, but they also attract rock climbers who consider climbing these steep walls a significant challenge. There are 300 spots from where to climb. Looking up, the clear blue sky above is the ultimate finish line as you grab the belay devices, carabiners, and necessary ropes to reach the heights of the Harau Valley. This valley is infrequently visited so that you may have the whole valley all to yourself.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; \"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Relaxing is one of the best time-elapsing activities here. Order a cup of coffee and local delicacies and settle down to write the last chapter of your travels and the extraordinary experiences you had in wonderful Indonesia. Take time for a short walk around the village and watch how people live. Some of the women here work in the rice fields while men plow the fields behind water buffalos, providing the perfect shot for you to take.</span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; \"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Public transportation is available for those wishing to spend the entire vacation time in and around Bukittinggi.
